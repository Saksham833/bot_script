# Purpose of the Script
The bot serves two main purposes:

# Anonymous Forwarding:
When a user sends a message, it is anonymously forwarded to all other users who have interacted with the bot.

# Admin Broadcasting:
The admin (identified by their Telegram user ID) can send broadcast messages to all users.
